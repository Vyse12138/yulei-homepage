        I started my uni journey at Swinburne University of Technology (SUT) in
        2018, with a bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) (professional)
        degree.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the third year of my uni, I found out that front-end development is
        what I'm passionate about and did some further study in the front-end
        area, then I got an internship opportunity as a front-end developer at
        Agriview. And in the next year, I accepted a 12-month placement offer as
        a full-stack developer at Movember.

              Worked in an agile team to develop web product. Used react +
              TypeScript + Node as the main tech stack, wrote robust (95% + Jest
              coverage) and elegant (airbnb based ESlint) code as well as
              reviewed teams' PRs.

              Refactored an old project with Vue3 and featured more responsive
              supports. Reduced some redundant code, and added clear comments to
              make it more extensible.
